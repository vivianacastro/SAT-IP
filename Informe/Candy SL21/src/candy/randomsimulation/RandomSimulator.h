     * detects possible equivalences and backbone literals in a given gate structure
     * by repeatedly applying random values to the gate structure's input variables
     * and then propagating the values through the gate structure, while observing
     * correspondences between literals rsp. literals and constants.
     *
     * Instances of this class are meant to be created using a RandomSimulatorBuilder
     * or a factory method.
