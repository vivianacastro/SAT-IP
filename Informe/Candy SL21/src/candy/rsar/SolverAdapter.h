     * \brief An adapter interface for Glucose-like solvers
     *
     * SolverAdapter is an adapter interface for Glucose-like solvers. The
     * intent of its creation is to increase the testability of ARSolver, as
     * Glucose itself cannot readily be mocked or faked. Therefore, this
     * subset of Glucose's interface is somewhat tailored to the ARSolver
     * implementation.
